Ted, I am not sure when you will need this information.

Stripe is for the initial billing.
Then it is transferred to my accounting software.
And it connects to my Zoho CRM.
I went into Stripe and set up 3 options for billing. See below. Please verify that they are working.
I will need you to verify in the developer tab that the client data is transferred into Zoho, into the CLIENTS folder, and also goes to Zar Money accounting software
